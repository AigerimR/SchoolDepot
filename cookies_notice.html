                Cookies are an important part of the internet. They make using
                devices and accessing online information much smoother and
                affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many
                different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups.
                Cookies that are needed to provide the content, product or
                service you have asked for Some cookies are essential to help
                your devices download or stream the information, or so you can
                move around websites and use their features. Without these
                cookies, content, products or services you've asked for can't be
                provided. Here are some examples of essential cookies.
                Positioning information on a smartphone screen, tablet device or
                other screen so that you can see the website and use its
                functionality. Keeping you logged in during your visit or

                to log in on every website you visit or repeatedly adjust your
                volume and viewing settings. When you add something to the
                online shopping basket, cookies make sure it's still there when
                you get to the checkout. Some are session cookies which make it
                possible to navigate through the website smoothly.

              <p>
                Cookies allow the application or website to remember choices you
                make, such as your language or region and they provide improved
                features. Here are a few examples of just some of the ways that
                cookies are used to improve your experience on our applications
                and websites: Remembering your preferences and settings,
                including marketing preferences, such as choosing whether you
                wish to receive marketing information. Remembering if you've
                filled in a survey, so you're not asked to do it again.
                Remembering if you've been to the application or website before.
                Restricting the number of times you're shown a particular
                advertisement. This is sometimes called 'frequency capping'.
                Showing you information that's relevant to content, products or
                services that you receive. Giving you access to content provided
                by social-media sites like Facebook or Twitter. Showing 'related
                article' links that are relevant to the information you're
                looking at. Remembering an application or website you've
                entered, such as weather forecasts.

              <h4>Analytics</h4>
              <p>
                We like to keep track of what websites, information and links
                are popular and which ones don't get used so much, to help us
                keep our information relevant and up to date. It's also very
                useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate
                (find their way through) our information and when and where
                'error messages' may originate. This group of cookies, often
                called 'analytics cookies' are used to gather this information.
                The information collected is grouped with the information from
                everyone else.s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of
                usage rather than any one person.s activity. Analytics cookies
                are used to improve how an application, a website and its pages
                work. Our applications, web locations, websites and
                communications you get from us also contain small invisible
                images known as 'web beacons' or ' pixels'. These are used to
                count the number of times the page or email has been viewed and
                allows us to measure the effectiveness of the communication.

            <section id="affiliate_cookies">
              <h4>Affiliate cookies</h4>
              <p>
                We also use 'affiliate' cookies. Some of our web based
                information will contain promotional links to other companies.
                sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with
                or buy something from that other site, a cookie is used to tell
                the other site that you came from one of our sites. That other
                site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral.
                For more information, see the Internet Advertising Bureau's
                guide about how affiliate marketing works. How we show
                advertising and marketing that is relevant to your interests We
                sell space on some of our websites to advertisers. The resulting
                adverts often contain cookies. The advertiser uses the browsing
                information collected from these cookies to: restrict the number
                of times you see the same ad (frequency capping) and help show
                other advertisements that are relevant to you while you're
                accessing our information. This information about your browsing
                activity may be grouped with information about what is being
                accessed by other users, into interest groups, and then used to
                show you advertisements based on those interests. This is often
                called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of
                using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by
                using cookies, to group you with other users into interest
                groups and show you advertisements based on those interests.
                Sometimes our websites contain advertisements for our own our
                products. These advertisements use cookies in the same way as
                described above.

              <p>
                Virtually all modern browsers allow you to see what cookies
                you've got, and to clear them individually or clear all of them.
                To find out how to do this go to aboutcookies.org, which
                contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide
                variety of desktop browsers. How can I choose not to receive
                Online Behavioural Advertising and other tracking cookies? In
                addition to the controls available on your computer, there are
                other ways of choosing not to receive Online Behavioural
                Advertising and other tracking cookies. Please note that most of
                these choices work by setting a cookie that overrides the
                behavioural advertising cookie. If you clear all your cookies,
                you will also clear these opt-out cookies, therefore changing
                your preferences. In this instance you would need to choose
                again.
